# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis

**Problem Statement:**

Social media platforms like Twitter generate vast amounts of user-generated content that can provide valuable insights into public sentiment and opinion on various topics. However, the unstructured nature of this data can make it challenging to extract useful information. Can sentiment analysis of tweets using natural language processing techniques provide insights into people's attitudes and opinions on a particular topic, and help businesses, organizations, and policymakers make better decisions?

**Aim:**

	To perform sentiment analysis of tweets using the VADER module from NLTK toolkit.

**Introduction**

A business or a brand’s success depends solely on customer satisfaction. Suppose, if the customer does not like the product, you may have to work on the product to make it more efficient. So, for you to identify this, you will be required to analyze the sentiment of their opinions. Therefore, Sentiment analysis is basically defined as the process of identifying and categorizing opinions from a piece of text, thereby determining whether the opinion is positive or negative.

In this article, we will work on how to perform sentiment analysis using VADER. Sentiment analysis gives meaning to the text. Semantics helps us to interpret symbols, their types, and their relation with each other. Let us briefly understand what NLP actually is and also about the NLTK Library.

**What is NLP?**

NLP is an automatic way of manipulating or processing human language. We use NLP to extract meaningful data from textual data. There are various applications of NLP such as Sentiment Analysis, Chatbot, Speech Recognition, Machine Translation, spell checking, Information Extraction, Keyword search, Advertisement matching, etc. Some real-world examples are Google Assistant and Google translate.

**Software & Hardware Requirements:** Python IDE(Google Colab),nltk toolkit, VADER module.

**NLTK**

Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is one of the most powerful NLP libraries which contains packages to make machines understand human language and reply to them in an appropriate desired response. NLTK has many built-in packages to process our textual data at every stage. There are various stages in nltk processing such as data cleaning, visualization, vectorization, etc.

**Sentiment Analysis**

Sentiment analysis is used to find out the polarity of the text, which is positive, negative, or neutral. It is one of the advanced research areas in natural language processing. This is widely used in data mining, text mining, etc. It helps collect and analyze opinions about a brand or a product by processing blog posts, comments, reviews, tweets, etc.

**Applications of Sentiment Analysis**

**Social media monitoring:** As we all know, social media is taking over the world. More than 55% of customers share their reviews about purchases socially on many social networking sites. It’s almost difficult to analyze the reviews manually. Sentiment analysis lets us analyze and derive meaning from them.

**Brand monitoring:** Brand owners use sentiment analysis tools to keep track of the bad reviews about their brand. They can also use machine learning algorithms to predict outcomes based on the results derived using semantic analysis.

**Voice of customer:** Various sentiment analysis algorithms let us analyze the voice of the customers, such as the product that are most needed by the customers and also the products that are highly rated, etc. The brand owners can create a personalized customer experience based on these evaluations.

**Customer service:** Chatbots are a widespread way of delivering good customer service. Using sentiment analysis, you can transfer the chat to a customer service associate whenever needed. Also, you can automate the tasks such as booking a ticket, an appointment for a salon, etc.

**Market research:** Using sentiment analysis, you can research how well your competitors are growing and what are their positive feedbacks from the customers. You can also analyze the way they deal with their customers. You can, in turn, work on the issues related to your product’s failure.

**Product Analysis:** You can do keyword research to identify the products in demand and the highly rated products. You can also determine what features of a particular product are highly appreciated by the customers or the end users.

**NLTK’s VADER module**

VADER( Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning) is an NLTK module that provides sentiment scores based on the words used. It is a rule-based sentiment analyzer in which the terms are generally labeled as per their semantic orientation as either positive or negative.
